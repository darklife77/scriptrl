# Learn With IRL

Learnwithirl is a library that uses real life circumstances and procedures to learn how to code with node.js.

**This library is not finished, expect more commits soon.**

## Please Note

Learnwithirl currently only has a d.ts file and examples so don't try running anything since you'll just get "undefined" errors. This will be changed in the future.
